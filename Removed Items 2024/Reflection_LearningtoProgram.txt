I should learn how to program because it will make me smarter, computers grow faster than me, and I can be lazy.
One thing I want to be able to do is get a job and get paid for doing very little work. Learning programing can help me with that because I can writing and modifying, and test code that allows software to fuction and get paid a lot with a flexiable work schedule.
