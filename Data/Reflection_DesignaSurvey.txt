 1. Water Quality
    I would measure things like the pH, oxygen level and how cloudy the water is. This can help determine how clean the water is. For instance,  low oxygen levels or cloudy water can indicate pollution, and it could be harmful to the river's ecosystem.
2. Animals and Plants: 
     I would observe and count the species of animals and plants in the river.  If I notice that specific species are missing or dying, it could mean the water is too polluted for them to survive.
3. Pollutants:
    I would test the water for harmful chemicals, like metals or pesticides. This shows how much pollution is in the water and where it might be coming from.
