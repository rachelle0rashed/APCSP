The expected user of my program is anyone who would like to use the filter to change the contrast of their image. The user provides the image, and the code adjust the contrast, returns the image modified. 
The student created is function custom_filter(pixel). This function first inputs a pixel, which is a list of 3 values (red, green, blue), then doubles each color channel. The min() function is used to make sure that the new color values do not go over 255. The output of this function returns a list of new color values [new_red, new_green, new_blue].
 The custom_filter(pixel) functions changes the colors of a pixel to make it brighter and more colorful. This helps the program achieve its goal of making the entire image look more vibrant.
In the custom_filter function, the list being used is the pixel list. The pixel list is an input to the function, and it represents a single pixel in an image. The list contains three numbers, each representing a color in a pixel. The first number is for red, second number is for green, and third number is for blue. Each number can be between 0 (no color) and 255 (the strongest color). These values put together will make the color of the pixel.
The list makes it easier to work with all three colors at once. Without it, you would need more code to handle each color separately. The list keeps things organized, and simple.
The first iteration statement in the program is inside the vibrant_filter(image) function, where there are two for loops. The first for loop "(for x in range(image.get_width()))" will iterate over the width of the image "image.get_width()" times. The second for loop "(for y in range(image.get_height()))" will iterate over the height of the image, "image.get_height()" times. This means each pixels in the image will run once. An infinite loop could occur if the range() function is given an invalid value. 
Returning a single value instead of a list in custom_filter(pixel) would cause the program to fail. The procedure should always return a list of three color values for proper functioning.
