1. I expect the expected user of my program woud be a spy. The program's design meet thre needs ogf the user because it protects sensitive information.  
2. The students-created funtion encodes and desodes messages by using sequencing to order steps, checking if numbers and even, and processing each number one at a time. 
The proceduce encodes and decodes messages by checking if a number is even or odd and changes the value properly to decode the entire messsage.
pixel_value = [0,0,0] would be the array used in the program, and the three zeros are being stored. 
This simplifies the process by reducing the number of lines and avoiding the need for extra variables to store each value separately. 
It will execute 3 times, and an error causing an infinite loop would occur if the array is empty.
Comparing the array to a letter would cause an error because they are different data types.
