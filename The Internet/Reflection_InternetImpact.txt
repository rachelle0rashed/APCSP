Online shopping can be seen as both beneficial and harmful-
   Benefical: You can shop from home at any time, saving time and effort.  Have access to a wider range of products. 
   Harmful: More people buying online means fewer people working in physical stores, which can lead to job cuts. Also can lead to over-spending.
