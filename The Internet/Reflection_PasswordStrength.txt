ex:qkffsbet  There are 208 billion possible combinations. This is a weak password and can be quickly using brute-force attacks.
ex: QwErTyUi there are 53 trillion possible combinations. This is much stronger than just lowercase. 
Ex: P@ssw0rD there are 6 quadrillion possible combinations. This is  stronger and significantly harder to crack.
Ex: longpasswordexamplehere 10^84 possible combinations. This is much harder to crack than an 8-character password with all character types.
A longer password is usually stronger than a short, harder password to solve.
The longer the password, the harder it is to crack. A long password, even with just lowercase letters, is much stronger than a short one. Adding uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols helps, but length is the biggest factor in making a password secure.
