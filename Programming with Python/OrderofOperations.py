"""

Programming languages follow the order of operations. Let's test this out.

Below is an expression. An expression can consist of a single value, a variable, 
an operator, or a procedure call that returns a value.

"""


first = 3
second = 7
third = 2
expression = (first + second) % third
print(expression)


"""

1. Change the second operator (the addition sign) to multiplication and run 
code. Which operation (add or multiply) is completed first?

2. Change the second operator (the one you changed to multiplication) 
to % (modulus or MOD). Which operation is completed first this time?

3. Can you change the expression so that the addition is completed first? How?
