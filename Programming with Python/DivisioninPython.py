Division in Python 3 can be done one of two ways:
/  - using a single slash, the results are returned as a real number
// - using two slashes, the results are returned only as a truncated integer
"""

# Should print the integer 2
int_division1 = 4 // 2
print(int_division1)

# Should print the float 2.0
real_division1 = 4 / 2
print(real_division1)

# 2 divided by 4 is 0.5, but it gets truncated to 0
int_division2 = 2 // 4
print(int_division2)

# Since this is returning a float, it prints 0.5
